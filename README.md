## My process

### Built with

- HTML | CSS
- Bootstrap 

### Continued development

- Refactor code. I feel like there is too many CSS.
- Submit a solution without Bootstrap. [Status Completed](https://github.com/CKodes/FEM.SinglePriceGridComponent) 

### Useful resources

[Google Extensions: ColorPick Eyedropper](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/colorpick-eyedropper/ohcpnigalekghcmgcdcenkpelffpdolg?hl=en)
- I did not have access to the Figma files for this solution and the colors on the free starter files seemed off so I used this tool to find the closest matching color to the design.
